# Devanagari-Transcriptor for Sanskrit

This is a simple [js-Application](https://sprachen.acamat.de/sanskrit/Transcriptor.htm), which transcripts Itx-Coding into Devanagari. Simply enter an valid Itx coding and press „Apply“ or Alt+Shift+A (Firefox) to see the Devanagari and Iast representation as well as the Html source code. This version is currently designed for and tested with Firefox 102.0 (Mozilla Firefox for Ubuntu – Canonical – 1.0) only. Bug-Reports, comments and suggestions are very welcome to me. This program is intended for public domain use. Enjoy!
